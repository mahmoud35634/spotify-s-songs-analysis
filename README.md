Overview
With the vast amount of music available on Spotify, analyzing song features can provide insights into trends, genres, and user preferences. This project aims to analyze Spotify songs using various data attributes such as tempo, energy, danceability, and more to uncover patterns and trends in music consumption and production.

Features
Data Collection: Extracting song data from the Spotify API, including attributes like tempo, energy, danceability, valence, and more.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the distribution and relationships of song attributes.
Trend Analysis: Identifying trends in music over time, across genres, and among popular songs.
Clustering and Classification: Grouping songs into clusters based on their attributes and building classification models to predict genres or popularity.
Recommendation System: Developing a system to recommend songs based on user preferences and song attributes.
Data
The dataset includes a wide range of song attributes extracted from the Spotify API. Each song entry contains information such as track name, artist, album, release date, tempo, energy, danceability, valence, and more.


Usage
Data Collection:

Use the Spotify API to fetch song data.
Store the data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, database).
Data Preprocessing:

Clean the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Normalize numerical attributes for uniform analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of song attributes.
Identify correlations and relationships between different attributes.
Analyze trends over time and across genres.
Trend Analysis:

Use time series analysis to identify trends in music attributes.
Compare trends across different genres and popularity levels.
Clustering and Classification:

Apply clustering algorithms to group songs based on their attributes.
Build classification models to predict song genres or popularity.
Recommendation System:

Develop a recommendation algorithm to suggest songs based on user preferences.
Integrate the recommendation system into a web application for user interaction.
Results
The project provides valuable insights into the characteristics of Spotify songs. Key findings include trends in music attributes over time, genre-specific patterns, and the development of a recommendation system that suggests songs based on user preferences. The final models and visualizations offer a comprehensive understanding of the music landscape on Spotify.

Future Work
Enhanced Data Collection: Incorporate additional song attributes and metadata for a more comprehensive analysis.
Advanced Modeling: Explore more sophisticated machine learning algorithms for clustering and classification.
User Personalization: Improve the recommendation system with user feedback and personalization features.
Real-time Analysis: Implement real-time data collection and analysis for dynamic insights.
